### Gold and Copper Prices - Can They Be Predicted?
#### Gold and Copper prices, what the mining industry uses to determine profitability and production rates, can be eratic to say the least. The goal of this project is to determine if a cycle (or super-cycle) can be identified to accurately predict future Gold and Copper prices.
Data sources will include
* 30 years of Gold and Copper commodity pricing, broken down by month, week, and day
* Top 5 mining companies for both Gold and Copper (publically traded) 10+ year production values
* Top 5 countries based on Gold and Copper production - 10+ year production AND world reserve values
* Top 5 country industrial production growth rates for up to 30 years. Top countries are based on global industrial product output

##### Possible Visualizations
* Gold and Copper pricing, variable y-axes, with 30 year monthly, and sliding scale weekly/daily pricing on x-axis
* Production for Gold and Copper as variable y-axis for all 5 companies along time scale
* Production, Reserves, Prices, and Industrial Production Growth Rate by country along time scale
* Race bar chart for company and countries on total Gold and Copper productions to show how they have competed against each other
* Multi-variable regression on Price based on industrial production growth, and mining production and reserves

Note: It can be reasonably assumed that demand is a function of production and reserves (acting together as supply) so demand itself will not be used
